# clojure-by-example

This project will contain thoroughly documented step-by-step instruction and example usage for a variety of Clojure-related concepts, libraries, and technologies.

## Organization

This project is organized into packages by subject.

If there is enough material for a given subject, I will try to include a readme called `main.md` at the package root describing how to navigate it.

## Feedback

I welcome feedback, improvements, and corrections.

These may be submitted as Github issues or through a PR.
